Items from Zach at Indeed:
  ☐ Completeness of the exercise is critical.
  ☐ The final submitted work should be functional and working correctly.
  ☐ Bug free (Important)
  ☐ Level of design polish (Important) - Make it look pleasing both ux and visual.
  ☐ Code quality (Important) - Focus on scalability, flexibility, and manageability.  Don’t over engineer, but apply good best practices.
  ☐ Game dynamic (Important) - Approach it from the user’s standpoint.  What makes for a successful and interesting game?
  ☐ Impress us (Bonus) - Add some of your own flavor to WOW us. 

My Notes:
  ☐ Ball drop game
  ☐ Can change, soft focus
  ☐ Not on creativity 
  ☐ Big focus on accessibility
  ☐ Dynamic inject into HTML
  ☐ Hard on OOP (needs to be in components but can’t import react)
  ☐ Minor bugs are ok, major bugs not ok

Ideas that I have:
  ☐ No JavaScript libraries or frameworks allowed. So I will inject from seperate JS files
  ☐ For styling lets go with Grid/Flexbox
